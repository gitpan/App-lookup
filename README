NAME
    lookup - search the internet from your terminal

VERSION
    lookup version 0.01

USAGE
      lookup [--help] [--man] [--abbrevs] [--config-file FILE] [--sites]
             [--web-browser COMMAND] [--abbrevs] SITE QUERY

EXAMPLE
      # search google for the phrase 'perl is pretty awesome'
      lookup google 'perl is pretty awesome'

      # same thing, with abbreviated SITE g (or go, or goo, or goog
      # or ... you get the idea)
      lookup g 'perl is pretty awesome'

      # ditto, but arguments to QUERY are not quoted
      lookup google perl is pretty awesome

DESCRIPTION
    This is a simple command line program which lets you search the internet
    from the terminal. It's not exactly the most original idea out there. I
    personally have used various programs which pretty much do the same
    thing, (most of these even offer better user interface): custom web
    search feature in Firefox, similar feature in Quicksilver and Launchy, a
    fairly sophisticated command line program called googlecl, and an emacs
    lisp library called webjump.

    But this raises quiet a few problems, namely:

    * The inability to share my own custom sites defined in one program with
    another.
    * Some programs are tied to a specific platform, e.g. Quicksilver on
    OSX, Launchy on Windows, and webjump on emacs :p. See also: problem #1.

    This program offers a simple solution to said problems. It uses a plain
    text file configuration which you can use to add your own custom sites
    (and aliases, but more on that later). You can also use it to interface
    with other programs, see the section INTEGRATION WITH EMACS for an
    example.

    By default you're only able to search with google. You can search with
    more sites by putting the following in the file ~/.lookuprc (see
    CONFIGURATION FILE).

      [sites]
      bing = http://www.bing.com/search?q=%(query)

    Assuming that's the only thing you put in the config file (to make sure
    that the abbreviations don't clash), you'll be able to search with bing
    with either one of the following commands:

      lookup bing foobar
      lookup bin foobar
      lookup bi foobar
      lookup b foobar

OPTIONS
  REQUIRED
    SITE
        The site name, which can be abbreviated as long as the name remains
        unique.

    QUERY
        The query string. For convenience, the arguments do not have to be
        quoted/protected from the shell since the rest of the arguments
        (after SITE) are assumed to be the query string and eventually will
        be joined with the space character. These two commands work exactly
        the same:

          lookup google 'foo bar baz'

        vs

          lookup google foo bar baz

  OPTIONAL
    -h, --help
        Print short help message and exit.

    -m, --man
        Print the full documentation and exit. Make sure to read this
        document if you want to add your own sites or aliases.

    -v, --version
        Print this program version and exit.

    -c, --config-file FILE
        Use a different configuration file. Default location is ~/.lookuprc.

    -a, --abbrevs
        List all sites with their valid abbreviations and exit.

    -s, --sites
        List all site names with their corresponding url and exit.

    -w, --web-browser COMMAND
        Specify a different command to run the web browser. By default this
        program uses whatever command does the module Browser::Open return
        to open the web browser. You can use this option to specify other
        command to execute.

        NOTE: if you're using cygwin, you currently must specify this option
        (see CAVEATS, BUGS AND TODOS).

          lookup google foo -w 'cygstart'

        Other example:

          lookup google foo -w 'open -a Safari'

        On OSX, the above command will make this program use the application
        `Safari' (obviously it won't work on other platforms).

CONFIGURATION FILE
    You can manage user-defined sites and their aliases by putting the
    information in the configuration file, by default located at ~/.lookuprc
    (although you can change it with the option --config-file).

    It uses the ubiquitous INI file syntax. Sites information should be put
    under the heading called `[sites]' and aliases under the heading
    `[alias]'. Lines that are starting with the characters `#' or `;' are
    ignored. Whitespace in either the key or the value is legal.

  SITES
    The section `[sites]' is where we defined our own sites. Each item
    contains a pair of key and value, where the key is the name of the site,
    and the value is the url. For example:

      [sites]
      metacpan     = https://metacpan.org/search?q=%(query)

    This add a new site called `metacpan' which is associated with the url
    `https://metacpan.org/search?q=%(query)'. The string `%(query)' will be
    replaced with the query string supplied to the option QUERY.

  ALIASES
    Aliases let us shorten the site name, where the key is the alias name
    and the value is an already existing site name (this program will print
    a warning message if you specify an alias that doesn't point to a valid
    site).

    Continuing from the previous example, we can shorten the name `metacpan'
    into `m' by putting the following lines in the configuration file:

      [alias]
      m = metacpan

    Now we can search for module called `Some::Module' on metacpan by
    invoking the command:

      lookup m Some::Module

  EXAMPLE OF CONFIGURATION FILE
    Here's an example of configuration file, feel free to use it as a
    starting point.

      [sites]

      duckduckgo   = http://duckduckgo.com/?q=%(query)
      emacswiki    = http://google.com/search?q=site:emacswiki.org %(query)
      github       = https://github.com/search?q=%(query)
      google lucky = http://google.com/search?btnI=1&q=%(query)
      imdb         = http://www.imdb.com/find?q=%(query)
      metacpan     = https://metacpan.org/search?q=%(query)
      perldoc      = http://perldoc.perl.org/search.html?q=%(query)
      search cpan  = http://search.cpan.org/search?query=%(query)&mode=all
      wikipedia    = http://en.wikipedia.org/?search=%(query)
      youtube      = http://www.youtube.com/results?q=%(query)

      [alias]

      ddg   = duckduckgo
      g     = google
      lucky = google lucky
      wi    = wikipedia
      y     = youtube

EXTRAS
  INTEGRATION WITH EMACS
    Short demo <http://i.minus.com/inRg3aL2wGGQ5.gif>.

    This is my preferred way of using this program, so I guess bit makes
    sense that this section is a bit long (mostly filled with emacs lisp
    code). You can safely ignore this section if you don't use emacs.

        "The lookup command.

      If you're using cygwin, you should modify this variable like so

          (when (eq 'system-type 'cygwin)
            (setq lookup-command \"lookup -w 'cygstart'\"))"

      (global-set-key (kbd "C-c w") 'lookup)
      (global-set-key (kbd "C-c W") 'lookup-quick)
